Credit Card Approval Prediction
This project focuses on predicting credit card application approvals using a credit card dataset. The goal is to build, describe, and present binary classification models to determine whether an application is likely to be approved or rejected.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features that describe various characteristics of credit card applicants, such as age, income, employment status, and other factors that might influence the approval decision. The data is provided on the QM+ module page.

Objective
The primary objective is to implement and evaluate several binary classification models to accurately predict the approval outcome of credit card applications. By utilizing a range of features provided in the dataset, we aim to identify key factors contributing to credit card approval and develop a robust predictive model.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the structure and relationships within the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric data.
Model Implementation: Build and evaluate multiple binary classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to predict the credit card approval outcome.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For model building, training, and evaluation.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For visualizing data trends and model performance.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the data analysis, model building, and evaluation process.

Conclusion
The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of predicting credit card approvals, from data exploration and feature engineering to model building and evaluation, providing insights into the variables that impact credit card application outcomes.
